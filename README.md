Maya Scene Optimizer
Description
The Maya Scene Optimizer is a Python script designed to streamline the workflow of optimizing 3D scenes in Autodesk Maya. This tool automates common optimization tasks such as removing construction history, resetting transformations, moving objects to the origin, and duplicating objects with random offsets. Additionally, it provides performance metrics to measure the impact of optimizations on scene size, render times, and resource usage.

Features
Optimization Options: Select from a variety of optimization options using checkboxes.
Submit Changes: Apply selected optimizations to the scene with the click of a button.
Performance Metrics: View detailed performance metrics before and after optimizations.
User-friendly UI: Intuitive user interface for easy navigation and operation.
Customization: Easily customizable and extendable for specific project requirements.
